# Idle / İşletmeler ownership

This directory is the complete Idle / İşletmeler frontend ownership root.

Idle work may modify this directory, `artifacts/cascade-8/public/businesses/**`, and the Idle API root declared in `.github/game-ownership.json`.

Idle work must not modify Slot, Roulette, Cadı Kazan, Hub, or shared/platform files during a normal game update.

The Businesses route shell, route body state, CSS reset/foundation, UI, components, services and tests live here. Do not rely on Slot/Hub `styles.css` for layout or reset behavior.

An Idle commit never publishes itself to Replit; only the central one-game promotion workflow may update the Idle slice of `integration/replit-preview`.

## Isolation v2 is active
- Work only on `feature/idle` and only inside Idle-owned roots from `.github/game-ownership.json`.
- Do not merge or push the whole feature branch into `integration/replit-preview`.
- Do not touch Replit. Replit stays on `integration/replit-preview`.
- A commit only saves Idle work. Preview release is a separate central promotion that copies only Idle-owned roots.
- If a task appears to require Hub, another game, wallet/platform, shared router/build/schema files, stop and hand it to the central integration conversation.
