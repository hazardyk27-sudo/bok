# Idle / İşletmeler ownership

This directory is the complete Idle / İşletmeler frontend ownership root.

Idle work may modify this directory, `artifacts/cascade-8/public/businesses/**`, and the Idle API root declared in `.github/game-ownership.json`.

Idle work must not modify Slot, Roulette, Cadı Kazan, Hub, or shared/platform files during a normal game update.

The Businesses route shell, route body state, CSS reset/foundation, UI, components, services and tests live here. Do not rely on Slot/Hub `styles.css` for layout or reset behavior.

An Idle commit never publishes itself to Replit; only the central one-game promotion workflow may update the Idle slice of `integration/replit-preview`.

## Isolation v2 is active
- Work only on `feature/idle` and only inside Idle-owned roots from `.github/game-ownership.json`.
- Do not merge or push the whole feature branch into `integration/replit-preview`.
- Do not touch Replit. Replit stays on `integration/replit-preview`.
- A commit only saves Idle work. Preview release is a separate central promotion that copies only Idle-owned roots.
- If a task appears to require Hub, another game, wallet/platform, shared router/build/schema files, stop and hand it to the central integration conversation.

## Milestone continuity
- Read `Current milestones` before starting substantial work in this category.
- Add a milestone only for durable state that the next agent would otherwise have to rediscover: an important decision, completed phase, validated baseline, major root cause/blocker, or next agreed checkpoint.
- Do not log routine micro-edits, every commit, raw test output, failed experiments, or temporary observations.
- Keep the list curated and short (normally 5–10 bullets), newest first. Replace or remove superseded items instead of appending forever.
- Preferred format: `YYYY-MM-DD — Milestone — current result/state. Next: ...`
- Before a meaningful handoff/new chat, update this section if the durable state changed.
- This milestone section belongs to Idle / İşletmeler; updating it is allowed on `feature/idle` because this `AGENTS.md` is inside the category's owned root.
- If a note conflicts with code/tests/ownership rules, the validated repository state wins.

## Current milestones
- 2026-09-27 — Slate Blue Parts 1–14 complete — Stadium, club store, and fan-club cards use the approved 380 × 214 WEBP visuals with no image color filter and no dark visual-shade overlay; responsive media slots remain unchanged. Next: promote to `integration/replit-preview` and visually QA.
- 2026-09-26 — Isolation v2 active — Idle / İşletmeler development stays on `feature/idle`; preview release is ownership-scoped into `integration/replit-preview`, not a whole-branch merge.
