# Slot ownership

This directory is the Slot frontend ownership root.

Normal Slot work may modify this directory plus the Slot-owned config, engine, game, simulation and API roots declared in `.github/game-ownership.json`.

Slot work must not modify Roulette, Cadı Kazan, Idle, Hub, or shared/platform files.

The Slot route markup, controller bootstrap and Slot stylesheet are owned here. A Slot commit never publishes itself to Replit; only the central one-game promotion workflow may update the Slot slice of `integration/replit-preview`.

## Isolation v2 is active
- Work only on `feature/slot` and only inside Slot-owned roots from `.github/game-ownership.json`.
- Do not merge or push the whole feature branch into `integration/replit-preview`.
- Do not touch Replit. Replit stays on `integration/replit-preview`.
- A commit only saves Slot work. Preview release is a separate central promotion that copies only Slot-owned roots.
- If a task appears to require Hub, another game, wallet/platform, shared router/build/schema files, stop and hand it to the central integration conversation.
